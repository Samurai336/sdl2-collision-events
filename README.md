sdl2-collision-events
=====================

Tutorial from http://www.sdltutorials.com/sdl-collision-events converted to use SDL2 RC.

to compile create build folder in the directory and put your platform specific build target there.  
and run: 
$ cmake ..

Note on SDL2: 
You will probably have to build SDL2 from scratch. There are prebuilt binaries for windows; both can be found at http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/download-2.0.php
You will also need SDL2_image which can be acquired here. http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL_image/. 

Have fun. 

tldr;
$cd  whereTheProjectIs/sdl2-collision-events
$mkdir build 
$cd build 
$ cmake .. 

OR just use the cmake gui
