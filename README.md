sdl2-collision-events
=====================

Tutorial from http://www.sdltutorials.com/sdl-collision-events converted to use SDL2 RC.

to compile create build folder in the directory, put you platform specific build tatget there with cmake 
then move the folders maps/ tilesets/ and the file yoshi.png to build/. Then compile and run. 


Note on SDL2: 
not in repos yes so you will probably have to build from scratch. There are pre build binaries for windows at http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/download-2.0.php
you will also need SDL2_image wich can be aquired here. http://www.libsdl.org/tmp/SDL_image/.
